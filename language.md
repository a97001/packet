Packets are defined using an object. The name of the packet is the object
property name, the definition is the object property value.

```javascript
define({
    ip: {
        header: [{
            version: 4,
            headerLength: 4
        }, 8 ],
        length: 16,
        identification: 16,
        foo: [{
            flags: 3,
            fragmentOffset: 13
        }, 16 ],
        timeToLive: 8,
        protocol: 8,
        checksum: 16,
        sourceAddress: 32,
        description: 32
    }
})
```

The above is the definition of an IP packet. The name of the packet is `ip`.

### Basic Assumptions

TK: Somewhere, a soliloquy about syntax bashing.

The Packet definition language is a syntax bashed language. It is specified in
JavaScript and transformed into JavaScript. There is no parsing except for the
parsing that the JavaScript does itself. This does make a few errors
undetectable at compile time, unfortunately.

We expect you to ship the generated serializers and parsers and not to create
definitions on the fly. Maybe you want to build a general purpose tool of some
sort, and maybe Packet can help, or maybe it can only serve as inspiration, but
we're not going to accommodate headless generation of serializers and parsers in
response to data going out or coming in over the wire.

Packet is written for Node.js 12. It uses features of ES2015 and breaks without
them. The serializer and parser generator has been tested on Node.js 12 as have
the generated serializers and parsers. The generator is designed to run in
Node.js 12. The generated parsers and serializers should run in any modern
JavaScript interpreter, but I've not built an API for streaming except against
Node.js streams. (Hmm... WebSockets?)

The generator depends on the order of insertion of the object properties of the
defintion. This used to be a _de facto_ standard of JavaScript but ES2015 made
it official.

With the exception of packed integers, we assume that the underlying protocol
uses 8-bit bytes and that integers sizes are multiples of 8-bits. There are
machines from the days of yore with 18-bit words and 9-bit bytes and the like,
but 8-bits has been the standard since the 1970's.

### Whole Integers

Outside of packed integers we assume that binary integers sizes are multiples of
8 bits. You specify the size of a whole integer in bits.

In the following defintion `value` is a 16-bit whole integer with valid values
from 0 to 65535.

**Mnemonic**: Number of bits, as opposed to bytes so that numbers remain
consistent when bit packing.

```
define({
    packet: {
        value: 16
    }
})

serialize({ value: 0xabcd }) // => [ 0xab, 0xcd ]
```

If you define a whole integer as greter than 32-bits it will be parsed and
serialized as a `BigInt`. The parser will create a `BigInt`. You must provide a
`BigInt` value to the serializer as the serializer will not perform a `number`
to `BitInt` conversion.

```
define({
    value: 64
})
```

### Negative Integers

Integers with potential negative values are generally represented as two's
compliment integers on most machines. To parse and serialize as two's complient
you preceed the bit length of an integer field with a `-` negative symbol.

In the following defination `value` is a two's compliment 16 bit integer with
valid values from -32768 to 32767. Two's compliment is a binary representation
of negative numbers.

**Mnemonic**: Negative symbol to indicate a negative value.

```javascript
define({
    value: -16
})
```

### Endianness

By default, all numbers are written out big-endian, where the bytes are written
from the most significant to the least significant. The same order in which
you'd specify the value as a hexadecimal literal in JavaScript.

Little-endian means that the bytes are serialized from the least significant
byte to the most significant byte. Note that this is the order of *bytes* and
not *bits*. This would be the case if you wrote an integer out directly to a
file from a C program on an Intel machine.

To parse and serialize an integer as little-endian you preceed the bit length of
an integer field with a `~` tilde.

**Mnemonic**: The tilde is curvy and we're mixing up the bits like that.

```javascript
define({
    value: ~16
})
```

If you want a little-endian negative number combine both `-` and `~`. The
following defines an object that has two 16-bit two's compliment little-endian
integers.

```javascript
define({
    message: {
        first: ~-16,
        second: -~16
    }
})
```

### Literals

### Nested Structures

You can nest structures arbitrarily. The structure itself is not serialized nor
parsed in any way. It is merely a way of grouping values extracted from the
binary stream.

```javascript
define({
    message: {
        header: {
            type: 8,
            length: 16
        },
        options: {
            encrypted: 8,
            checksum: 32
        }
    }
})
```

### Packed Integers

Packed integers are expressed as nested structures grouped in an `Array`
followed by an integer definition of the packed integer size. The byte lengths
in the packed integer must sum to the size of the packed integer.

Packed integer fields are always big-endian and cannot be made little endian.
Packed integer fields can be made two's compliment by preceeding the field bit
length with a `-` negative symbol just like whole integers.

A packed 32-bit integer with a single two's compliment (potentially negative)
value named `volume`.

The bit length values of the packed values sum to 32. Note that we consider
`volume` to be 11 bits and not -11 bits in this summation of packed field
values.

```javascript
define({
    message: {
        header: [{
            type: 4,
            encrypted: 1,
            volume: -11,
            length: 16
        }, 32 ],
    }
})
```

The packed integer will be serialized as big-endian by default. You can specify
that the packed integer is serialized as little-endian by proceeding the bit
length with a `~` tilde.

```javascript
define({
    message: {
        header: [{
            type: 4,
            encrypted: 1,
            volume: -11,
            length: 16
        }, ~32 ],
    }
})
```

### Inline Transforms and Assertions

Inline transforms are specified by wrapping a field definition in an array with
a pre-serialization function before or a post-parsing function after it or both.
The pre-serialization function and post-parsing function must be encosed in an
array.

A pre-serialization transformation function takes the value from the JavaScript
object and returns the transfored that is then written to the stream. The
post-parsing transformation function takes a value extracted from the stream and
returns the transformed value that is assigned to the JavaScript object.

The following transform will convert a hexidecmal string to an integer on
serialization and back to a hexidecimal string on parse.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[ $_ => parseInt($_, 16) ], 32, [ $_ => $_.toString(16) ]]
    }
})
```

**Mnemonic**: A function is obviously a function, it does something to in the
midst of parsing. We used functions elsewhere in the language, so we encode them
in arrays, The array backets act as parenthesis, these are parenthetical user
actions on the stream.

Whoa, what's with the parameter names pal? `$_` violates everything I was ever
taught about naming variables. How would you even pronounce that?

Well, my first real language was Perl, and good old "dollar under" is the
default variable for an array value when you loop through an array with
`foreach`. I miss those days, so I thought I revive them. No, don't cry. You can
name positional arguments anything you like, but I'll be using these names to
get you used to them, because they're available as named arguments as well.

You can also use named arguments via object desconstruction. When you do, you
must specify names that are in the current namespace. The namespace will contain
the object properties in the current path.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[ ({ value }) => parseInt(value, 16) ], 32, [ ({ value }) => value.toString(16) ]]
    }
})
```

But, if that takes up too much of your screen real estate, Perl-esque variables
names are also available to use as named arguments.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[ ({ $_ }) => parseInt($_, 16) ], 32, [ ({ $_ }) => $_.toString(16) ]]
    }
})
```

There are two Perl-esque variable names `$_` for the immediate property value,
and `$` for the root object. Any other system provided names such as `$i`,
`buffer`, `$start` and `$end` will begin with a `$` do distinguish them from
user specified names and to avoid namespace collisions.

**Mnemonic**: Borrowed from Perl `foreach` loop, `$_` is the immediate property
value, useful for its brevity. `$` is the root variable, the shortest special
variable because if you're starting from the root, you have a path ahead of you.

We'll continue to use `$_` and `$` in positional argument examples so we can all
get used to them.

The first argument to a transformation function with positional arguments is the
transformed value, the second argument is the root object being transformed.

The following WebSockets inspired example xors a value with a `mask` property in
the packet.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        mask: 32,
        value: [[ ($_, $) => $_ ^ $.mask ], 32 [ ($_, $) => value ^ $.mask ]]
    }
})
```

This can be expressed using named arguments. Note how we can order the arguments
any way we like.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        mask: 32,
        value: [[ ({ $, $_ }) => $_ ^ $.mask ], 32 [ ({ $_, $ }) => value ^ $.mask ]]
    }
})
```

You can also name the names of the object properties in the current path. Again,
note that the order of names does not matter with named arguments.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        mask: 32,
        value: [[
            ({ packet, value }) => value ^ packet.mask
        ], 32 [
            ({ value, packet }) => value ^ packet.mask
        ]]
    }
})
```

(Not to self: Seems like it might also be useful to be able to reference the
current object in a loop, which could be `$0` for the current object, `$1` for a
parent. This would be simplier than passing in the indicies, but that would be
simple enough, just give them the already existing `$i`. Heh, no make them
suffer.)

The third argument passed to a transformation function is an array of indices
indicating the index of each array in the path to the object. TK Move fixed
arrays above.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        array: [[ 4 ], {
            mask: 32,
            value: [[
                ($_, $, $i) => $_ ^ $.array[$i[0]].mask
            ], 32 [
                ($_, $, $i) => $_ ^ $.array[$i[0]].mask
            ]]
        })
    }
})
```

We can use named arguments as well.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        array: [[ 4 ], {
            mask: 32,
            value: [[
                ({ $_, $, $i }) => $_ ^ $.array[$i[0]].mask
            ], 32 [
                ({ $_, $, $i }) => $_ ^ $.array[$i[0]].mask
            ]]
        })
    }
})
```

We can also use the names of the object properties in the current path. The `$i`
array variable of is a special system property and it therefore retains its
dollar sign prepended name.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        array: [[ 4 ], {
            mask: 32,
            value: [[
                ({ value, packet, $i }) => value ^ packet.array[$i[0]].mask
            ], 32 [
                ({ value, packet, $i }) => value ^ packet.array[$i[0]].mask
            ]]
        })
    }
})
```

If your pre-serialization function and post-parsing function are the same you
can specify it once and use it for both serialization and parsing by surrounding
it with an additional array.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        mask: 32,
        value: [[[ ($_, $) => $_ ^ $.mask ]], 32 ]
    }
})
```

Note that the above functions can also be defined using `function` syntax. Arrow
functions are generally more concise, however.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        mask: 32,
        value: [[[ function ({ value, packet }) {
            return value ^ packet.mask
        } ]], 32 ]
    }
})
```

### Requiring Modules

The functions in our packet parser may depend on external libraries. We can

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[ $value => ip.toLong($value) ], 32, [ $value => ip.fromLong($value) ]]
    }
}, {
    require: { ip: 'ip' }
})
```

When can also use modules local to the current project using relative paths, but
we face a problem; we're not going to ship language definition with our
completed project, we're going to ship the generated software. Therefore,
relative must be relative to the generated file. Your relative paths much be
relative to the output directory... (eh, whatever. Maybe I can fix that up for
you.)

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[ $value => ip.toLong($value) ], 32, [ $value => ip.fromLong($value) ]]
    }
}, {
    require: { ip: '../ip' }
})
```

### Assertions

We can also perform inline assertions. You specify an assertion the same way you
specify a transformation. You wrap your definition in an array.
A pre-serialization assertion is a function within an array in the element
before the definition. A post-parsing assertions is a function within an array
in the element after the definition.

When performing inline assertions, we are not transforming a value, we're simply
checking it's validity and raising an exception if a value is invalid. You could
use a transformation to do this, but you would end up returning the value as is.

With an assertion function the return value is ignored. It is not used as the
serialization or assignment value.

To declare an assertion function you assign a default value of `0` or `null` to
the immediate property argument.

In the following definition we use a `0` default value for the immediate
property argument which indicates that the value and should not be used for
serialization for the pre-serialization function nor assignment for the
post-parsing function.

```
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[
            ($_ = 0) => assert($_ < 1000, 'excedes max value')
        ], 16, [[
            ($_ = 0) => assert($_ < 1000, 'excedes max value')
        ]]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

(I assume I'll implement this in this way:) The execption will propagate to the
API caller so that you can catch it in your code and cancel the serialization or
parse. (However, if I do wrap the assertion in a try/catch and rethrow it
somehow, then the following example is moot.

If you where to use a transform, you would have to return the value and your
definition would be more verbose.

```
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[
            $_ => {
                assert($_ < 1000, 'excedes max value')
                return $_
            }
        ], 16, [[
            $_ => {
                assert($_ < 1000, 'execdes max value')
                return $_
            }
        ]]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

You can use the name function for both pre-serialization and post-parsing by
surrounding the function in an additional array.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[[ ($_ = 0) => assert($_ < 1000, 'excedes max value') ]], 16 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

You can use named arguments to declare an assertion function.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[[ ({ $_ = 0 }) => assert($_ < 1000, 'excedes max value') ]], 16 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

### Assertion and Transformation Arguments

You can pass arguments to assertions and transforms. Any value in the array that
follows the function that is not itself a `function` is considered an argument
to the function. The arguments are passed in the order in which they are
specified preceding the immediate property value.

In the following definition the function is followed by a `number` argument
which is passed as the first parameter to the function in serializer or parser.

```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value: [[[ (max, $_ = 0) => assert($_ < max, `value excedes ${max}`), 1024 ]], 16 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

This is useful when defining a function that you use more than once in your
definition.

```javascript
const max = (max, $_ = 0) => assert($_ < max, `value excedes ${max}`)

define({
    packet: {
        length: [[[ max, 1024 ]], 16 ],
        type: [[[ max, 12 ]], 8 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

When using named arguments, the argument values are assigned to the named
parameters preceding the first variable that is defined in the current scope.
That is, the first occurrence of a variable name that is either the name of a
property in the current path or a system name beginning with `$` dollar sign.

In the following definition the first argument to the `max` function will be
assigned to the `max` named argument. The positional argument mapping stops at
the `$path` parameter since it is a system parameter beginning with `$` dollar
sign. The `'oops'` parameter of the `max` function call for the `type` property
will be ignored.

```javascript
const max = ({ max, $path, $_ = 0 }) => assert($_ < max, `${$path.pop()} excedes ${max}`)

define({
    packet: {
        length: [[[ max, 1024 ]], 16 ],
        type: [[[ max, 12, 'oops' ]], 8 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

In the following definition the first argument to the `max` function will be
assigned to the `max` named argument. The positional argument mapping stops at
the `packet` parameter since it is the name of a property &mdash; actually the
name of the root object &mdash; in the current path.

```javascript
function max ({ max, packet, $path, $_ = 0 }) {
    assert($_ < max, `${$path.pop()} excedes ${max} in packet ${packet.series}`)
}

define({
    packet: {
        series: [ 32 ],
        length: [[[ max, 1024 ]], 16 ],
        type: [[[ max, 12, 'oops' ]], 8 ]
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: require('assert') }
})
```

Note that you cannot use closures to define functions because we're using the
function source in the seiralizer and parser generation so the encoded value is
lost. You'll end up with global variables with undefined values.

You can reduce the verbosity of your code by creating functions that declare
functions for transforms or assertions that you perform on more than one . The
function declaration function will return a function that will be included in
the serializer or parser. If you give it a meaningful name



```javascript
define({
    packet: {
        value [[ ({ value = 0 })
    }
}, {
    require: { assert: 'assert' }
})
```

If you want to perform an assertion you can do so without returning a value
Transforms expect a return value and use that value for serialization or
assignment to the parsed object. You won't want to

If you want to perform an assertion and not
return a value you can

You can specify a function to be performed both before serializtion and after
parsing by surrounding the function with an additional set of parenthesis.

```
define({
    packet: {
        value [[[ value => ~value ]]], 32 ]
    }
})
```

These are more useful for running checksums and counting bytes, but since these
operations require accumuators of some sort, we'll

You are also able to apply functions to the underlying `Buffer` during parse and
serialization. See Checksums and Running Calculations.
